                With the internet’s transition from a communication-oriented invention to an ecommerce driven invention
                in the late 1990s, it was only a matter of time before the communication aspect of the internet took the
                forefront yet again. With the idea that everyone no matter your status can have the ability to put
                yourself out there for the world to see., big media companies were looking to throttle the content that
                they were distributing, in an attempt to make
                more money.

                One version of media, music, was targeted in the late 1990s and earlier 2000s by a small startup company
                named Napster. Napster revolutionized the idea that media, like music, should be accessible in more than
                just one channel, which at the time was just the record labels. This was the new wave of media, and it
                was
                going to take over whether the rich record label executives liked it or not. In the end, Napster were
                soon sued and forced to shut down their operations. However, this would not stop more and more websites
                like Napster to rise and take its place.

                With Napster in the past, companies like YouTube and Facebook sought to take advantage of the new way of
                media
                that they were witnessing. Although
                companies
                like Myspace posed a challenge to Facebook initially, in the long Facebook was able to outlast, which
                lead to the company growing to absurd proportions. As for YouTube, the
                founders
                were
                able to sell the company in 2006 to Google for around $1.6 billion, and the platform was able to explode
                from
                there, making it the media powerhouse it is today.

                All in all, media consumption has had many changes over the past few decades and
                the
                internet has made many great changes to society it has brought about some interesting villains. In
                today’s
                market, Facebook has grown to become an empire, but this came a severe cost. The company, some would
                say,
                lacks
                integrity and is straying away from its original purpose. While YouTube has not changed all too much
                purpose
                wise, the content restriction and enforcement has become a bit of a problem in recent years. Only time
                can
                tell
                where these giants are going to end up next.
