          With the growing technology by late 1990s, people are turning their sight from radio, tv to the internet. The
          new fashion of electronic shopping is coming. At the same time, two of the biggest e-commerce companies,
          Amazon and Ebay, are starting their business, and they are going to create a whole new model of commerce.

          One of the key points in security transport is public-key cryptography, which is created by Whitfield Diffie,
          Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle. Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic
          system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be disseminated widely, and private keys, which are
          known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical
          problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the
          public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.

          A critical rule that ensures the blooming of computer technology and the internet is Moore Rule. Moore's Law
          refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though the
          cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers
          to increase every couple of years, and we will pay less for them. Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that
          this growth is exponential, which means it would grow faster and faster.

          With Amazon and eBay taking off in the newly established ecommerce marketplace, Wall Street was eager to
          get a piece of the pie. With more and more user gaining access to and using the internet the potential
          to grow small no-name companies to monstrous billion-dollar companies was endless. The only issue that
          stood in the way of venture capitalists and analysts was greed. With billions of dollars being pumped into the
          industry a bubble, deemed the Dot Com Bubble, was
          created and stocks of Amazon, eBay, and other ecommerce sites sored.

          In 2002, the stock market to a huge plummet causing many investors to lose millions and several
          companies to end business operations. The combination of the Black Friday crash in 2000 and the 9/11
          attacks in 2001 caused the stock market to hit record lows, and therefore causing the Dot Com Bubble to
          official burst. Many investors were furious with Wall Street analysts, one in particular being Henry
          Blodget, who drove the rise of the Dot Com Bubble and watched it collapse before his eyes. After in
          depth investigations and court cases, Blodget was reprimanded by the SEC and banned from trading with
          IPOs again. Sadly, while Blodget did receive the brunt of the burst, he was not the cause of it.

          All in all, the Dot Com Bubble was a rush to get a piece of new landscape in the economic market that
          was never explored. Companies like Amazon and eBay were able to escape the bubble bursting and go on to
          become successful, but others were not so lucky. Finally, people get to realize the true aim of the internet:
          create values, and lead the further development of the internet.
