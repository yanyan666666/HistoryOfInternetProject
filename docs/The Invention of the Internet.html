            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">Inclusion guided its development. Intended to be as open as possible where
                    anyone could contribute or use.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Starting 1950s, idea behind Internet was envisioned by a psychologist called
                    JCR Licklider, a professor at MIT. His idea was that computers could be linked together which would
                    allow us to communicate better and would be beneficial in sharing of information.
                </li>


                <li class="list-group-item">Computers would have remained standalone monoliths, if not for USSR’s launch
                    of Sputnik in October 1957 that spurred the scientists into the idea of teamwork.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">To catchup and surpass the Soviet Union in space technology, President
                    Eisenhower created a division at the Defense Department call Advanced Research Projects Agency
                    (ARPA), in charge of the space program which included Computer Science.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Establishment of NASA gave an impetus to the space race but left research
                    into Computer Science behind.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">It moved slowly but kept making steady progress.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Leonard Kleinrock, a graduate student at MIT, began applying queuing theory
                    to data transmission.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Demand Access and Distributed Control, an idea for effective resource
                    sharing and shared control respectively are key principles.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Paul Baran was hired to see if a resilient network could be created which
                    would withstand nuclear attack.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Came up with “hot potato” routing which ensures a path remains viable even
                    if part of the network is destroyed.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Key is to break messages into small, equal sized chunks called packets which
                    included a to and from address.
                <li class="list-group-item">Packet switching research and theory matured in 1962 to show that it could
                    be built and used for computer communication. Actual implementation, in fact, didn’t happen until
                    1969.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">In 1966, Bob Taylor, of ARPA, needed a separate terminal to log into each
                    separate timeshare computers spread across the country. They didn’t talk to each other.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">He envisioned a network where one terminal could connect to all the
                    computers that were networked together.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for building the network. Roberts had already
                    built an experimental connection between two computers at an MIT library.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The contract to build the network based on Roberts’ instruction was awarded
                    to BBN. The initial plan was to network 4 computers, at UCSB, SRI, UCLA and Utah together on this
                    network. Work began in January 69 with first delivery planned 9 months later.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">First IMP, interface message processor, arrived at UCLA in September 1969.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">All 4 sites were interconnected by end of 1969.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">By April 1971, 18 mainframes were on the ARPANet network.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Raymond Tomlinson introduced email on the network in March 1972.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">October 1972 ARPA demonstrated the computer network in Washington, DC.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">In growing the Internet, the focus was on ideas and dialogue rather than
                    edicts and directives.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">By 1972 ARPANet had fewer than 25 sites online yet more were coming. What
                    sparked an interest was the first International Conference on Computer Communication sponsored by
                    ARPA.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">NSF required to be on their network to receive grant money.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">LANs and WANs emerged to connect offices and branches across buildings,
                    campuses and institutions.
                <li class="list-group-item">In 1973 Vin Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of rules to connect
                    disparate networks together, called TCP/IP protocol.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Tim Berners-Lee created World Wide Web in 1980. Allowed Internet to be free
                    and user friendly.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">In 1983, after 10 years of refinement, TCP/IP was adopted as the universal
                    standard. This allowed the rapid evolution of the Internet, a common network of interconnected
                    networks.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">In June 1992 Congress passed legislation taking the Internet out of the
                    hands of the Government and into public hands.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">50 web pages on the Internet in 1992.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Mosaic web brower developed 1993 by Marc Andreesen to allow users to
                    “browse” the Internet. Allowed the “web” to grow 341,000% shortly after.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">It is still under construction and will always be.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The history doesn’t capture the potential of the Internet…it’s grown and
                    reach is only limited by the human imagination and ingenuity.
